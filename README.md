# Repository_0
Ode to the age-old first program. 

About myself, just a tad:
BTW I'm Maisha, I like python and I am looking forwarding to writing awesome code that can be used by others to improve they way they tackle dull tasks. 

This first repository serves as a learning exercise as I navigate GitHub for the very first time. I am hoping for collaborators as that's the best way to build cool stuff.
